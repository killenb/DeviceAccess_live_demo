Source code used for the DeviceAccess live demo on the 6th MicroTCA Workshop, December 2017, in Hamburg.

The master branch contains the slides as a PDF. Check out the other branches to obtain the source code of the live demo. Start with branch demo2_start. It contains the .map file and .dmap file needed to run demo1 (QtHardMon), the .cpp file for demo2, and "delta" files with the changes between the demos. The other branches have the changes applied, respectively.
